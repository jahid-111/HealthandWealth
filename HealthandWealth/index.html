                    Chicken biryani is a delicious and aromatic rice dish that is popular in India. It is made with
                    chicken, rice, spices, and herbs. The chicken is first marinated in a mixture of spices, and then it
                    is cooked with the rice. The rice is cooked in a sealed pot, so that the flavors of the spices and
                    the chicken are infused into the rice. Chicken biryani is typically served with raita, a
                    yogurt-based side dish.
